* __Info:__ *I am a student of philological faculty, so my future occupation is expected to be connected with languages on the first place. I am a real fan of languages,so I am good at both English and German. However, working with languages does not necessarily mean being a translator or a teacher, that's why I would like to add programming languages to my list and try myself in IT-sphere which seems to be progressive and essential nowadays.Therefore, I am eager to study and get new experience in order to maintain and develop my future career.*
